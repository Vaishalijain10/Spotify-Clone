Practice - Spotify Clone using HTML & CSS Technologies. 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Description - 
Spotify is a leading digital music service that provides access 
to millions of songs and podcasts from artists worldwide. 
It allows users to discover new music, create playlists, and share
their favorite tracks with friends. Spotifyâ€™s intuitive interface 
and personalized recommendations have made it a popular choice 
for music enthusiasts. In my project, I aimed to replicate the main 
page of Spotify using HTML and CSS technologies. This involved designing 
a visually appealing and user-friendly interface that mirrors Spotify's 
sleek and modern design. The project features a dynamic layout with sections 
for featured playlists, recently played tracks, and popular albums, 
maintaining a responsive design that adapts to various screen sizes. 
Through this project, I enhanced my skills in HTML and CSS, focusing on 
layout structuring, styling techniques, and responsive design principles, 
striving to capture the essence of Spotify's user experience.
